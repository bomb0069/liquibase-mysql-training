# Database Schema Migration Setup - Summary

## What Was Created

This setup successfully created a complete Liquibase-based database schema migration system for a shopping cart application with the following components:

### 1. Database Structure (`database/` folder)
- **`Dockerfile`**: Custom Liquibase image with MySQL driver pre-installed
- **`changelog-master.xml`**: Main changelog file that orchestrates all migrations
- **`liquibase.properties`**: Liquibase configuration file
- **`changelogs/001-create-customer-table.xml`**: Customer-related table migrations
- **`README.md`**: Detailed documentation for the database migrations

### 2. Customer Schema
Successfully created and populated the following tables:

#### `customers` table:
- Primary customer information with email, names, phone, date of birth
- Includes sample data for 3 customers
- Features: auto-increment ID, unique email constraint, status field, timestamps

#### `customer_addresses` table:
- Customer shipping and billing addresses
- Foreign key relationship to customers table
- Supports multiple address types (SHIPPING, BILLING)
- Includes sample addresses for testing

### 3. Docker Integration
- **Custom Dockerfile**: Creates optimized Liquibase image with MySQL driver pre-installed
- **Updated `docker-compose.yml`**: Uses custom image for faster startup
- **Build automation**: Eliminates runtime driver downloads
- **Service Dependencies**: Liquibase waits for MySQL to be healthy before running

### 4. Migration Management Tools
- **`migrate.sh`**: Command-line helper script for common Liquibase operations
- **`build.sh`**: Custom image build and management script
- **Optimized Setup**: Pre-installed drivers, no runtime downloads

## Migration Results

✅ **Successfully Applied 4 Changesets:**
1. `001-create-customer-table`: Created customers table
2. `002-create-customer-addresses-table`: Created customer_addresses table with foreign key
3. `003-insert-sample-customers`: Inserted 3 sample customers
4. `004-insert-sample-addresses`: Inserted 2 sample addresses

## Verification Results

```

### Sample Data Inserted:
- **3 Customers**: John Doe, Jane Smith, Mike Johnson
- **2 Addresses**: New York shipping address, Los Angeles billing address

## How to Use

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Build custom image (first time only)
./build.sh build

# Start all services (includes automatic migration)
docker-compose up -d

# Check migration status
./migrate.sh status

# View database in Adminer
open http://localhost:8080
```

### Available Commands:
```bash
# Migration commands
./migrate.sh update    # Apply pending migrations
./migrate.sh status    # Check current status
./migrate.sh history   # View migration history
./migrate.sh rollback 1  # Rollback last migration
./migrate.sh validate  # Validate changelog syntax

# Image management commands
./build.sh build      # Build custom image
./build.sh rebuild    # Rebuild without cache
./build.sh info       # Show image details
./build.sh clean      # Remove custom image
```

## Key Benefits Achieved

1. **Version Control**: Database schema changes are now tracked in XML files
2. **Reproducible**: Same migrations can be applied to any environment
3. **Rollback Capability**: Each changeset includes rollback instructions
4. **Automated**: Migrations run automatically when containers start
5. **Optimized**: Custom Docker image with pre-installed MySQL driver
6. **Fast Startup**: No runtime driver downloads or configuration
7. **Documentation**: Each change is documented with comments
8. **Sample Data**: Includes test data for immediate development use
9. **Build Tools**: Scripts for image and migration management

## Next Steps

To add new migrations:
1. Create new XML files in `database/changelogs/`
2. Add them to `database/changelog-master.xml`
3. Run `./migrate.sh update` or restart containers

The system is now ready for continuous database schema evolution!
